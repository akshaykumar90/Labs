Labs for 18-842 Distributed Systems

Lab 0: Infrastructure

This lab is designed to get you thinking about testing harnesses for distributed systems construction. You will design a system to easily configure multiple nodes, allow them to pass messages, and allow testing operations on message delivery.

Lab 1: Clocks

In this lab, you will build a system to synchronize events happening at distributed nodes, using Logical and Vector clocks.

Lab 2: Multicast Communication

In this lab, you will demonstrate reliable, causally-ordered multicast messaging among your distributed nodes.

Lab 3: Mutual Exclusion

In this lab, you will implement the ability for distributed nodes to come to consensus about which node should be allowed exclusive access to some resource.
